### Findings
Observing and talking to the staff at Southdale led to a number of useful insights and findings to help guide the design process:

+ Employees need to be able to quickly and easily tell if a check-in is successful or failed, when they scan a card.
+ Employees rely on profile photos to verify members' identities, when they scan their cards – so being able to see a large photo is important.
+ Each member has a "nickname", which is their preferred name for being addressed by staff. These need to be easy to read, when a card is scanned.
+ The solution should must portable, so that it can also be used at outdoor events or in other situations, where member cards need to be scanned.

Maersk Line is the world’s largest container shipping company with more than 350 offices in more than 110 countries. As a leader in the shipping industry, the company prides itself on excellence in customer service and innovation – and wished to redesign their digital presence up to better reflect this. FFW were contacted to help Maersk Line achieve this goal.

My role
---------
I worked as Creative Lead on the project, and was responsible for the overall creative vision and execution. This included all discovery and conceptualization work and client contact, as well as hands on work with UX and UI design. Aside from me, the core project team counted an additional UX/UI designer, a project manager and a technical solutions architect.

Discovery
---------
The first important step in any successful redesign process is establishing a strong common understanding of the context and goals. To achieve this, we initiated the project with a number of internal discovery workshops at Maersk Line. The ultimate goal of these workshops was to uncover valuable insights about the organization, their goals and strategic priorities – and to learn about the purpose, challenges and opportunities with redesigning the website.

To qualify the information we gathered at the workshops, we also conducted several interviews and other types of research that allowed us to uncover important information about Maersk Line’s target audiences and their key actions and goals, competitive landscape, information architecture and content strategy, and brand guidelines.

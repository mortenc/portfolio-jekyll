The Golden Gate Bridge, Highway & Transportation District knew that they needed a new website, but weren’t sure where to begin. FFW helped them understand their needs and how best to deliver outstanding digital experiences to locals and tourists alike.

Majestic online, clunky offline
-------------------------------
The Golden Gate Bridge, Highway & Transportation District operates the Golden Gate Bridge and provides safe and reliable public transportation on Golden Gate Transit buses and Golden Gate Ferry. Last year, 38 million vehicles crossed the Golden Gate Bridge and over 9 million customers rode the transit systems. Millions more visitors came to or crossed the bridge each year, and those who try to find information online before arriving were frustrated by an antiquated, clunky website.

Understanding content chaos
---------------------------
The District determined that their website, goldengate.org, was outdated and difficult to use. It had grown organically over time, leading to content chaos, and the site itself lacked focus: the District serves both commuting locals and sightseeing tourists, and this duality was in conflict on their previous website. It was extremely difficult for their disparate audiences to find targeted content, either through search or through browsing. In addition, the site itself was visually unappealing, and the District did not feel that it reflected their organization.

## The Danish Broadcasting Corporation
DR – the Danish Broadcasting Corporation – is Denmark's public service media enterprise. Each week nearly every single Dane interacts with one of DR's touch points; tuning into a TV channel, turning on the radio or using one of DR's digital products.

### My Role
I'm currently leading the talented 10-person UX team that designs digital products at DR. Our product portfolio includes dr.dk (the most visited Danish website), DRTV and Radio streaming apps, DR's news app, children's apps, and many other products aimed at providing great public service for the Danish people.

Furthermore, I am responsble for our product discovery practices across the product management organization, where am working to ensure a *continuous discovery* mindset focused around user research, rapid prototyping and experimentation.

Among other things, I've been responsible for:

+ Growing the team from 6 to 10 fantastic UX strategists and product designers.
+ Transitioning from an “internal agency” model to a hub-and-spoke model with UX’ers and designers embedded in each of our cross-functional product teams.
+ Implementing Dual-Track Agile and Continuous Discovery practices.
+ Aligning UX tools and processes across the teams, and running UX meetings, design reviews, and weekly 1-on-1s.
+ Responsible for cross-team design efforts like our UX Playbook, design system (DR Elements), and key cross-product strategic initiatives (Personalization, etc).

## Selected Work
Below are examples of the work, I'm invovled in at DR – both currently on-going and past projects.

### Redesigning the Front Page of dr.dk (Work-In-Progress)
[DR.dk](https://www.dr.dk){:rel="noreferrer"} is one of the most visited Danish websites, and the front page – with its more than 1.2 million unique visitors a week – plays a particularly important role for Danish news and media consumption.

We are currently in the process of redesigning and testing the front page to ensure that it is personal and relevant to our users' diverse needs. We expect a staged beta rollout to happen during the summer of 2019.

### Dual Track Agile + Continuous Discovery
Over the past year the team and I have worked to implement Dual Track Agile across the department, and ensure that continuous discovery practices such as user research, prototyping and experimentation are first-class citizens in our teams' backlogs.

This has included transitioning UX from an “internal agency” model to a hub-and-spoke model with UX’ers and designers embedded in each of our cross-functional product teams.

### Design System - DR Elements
The team and I are responsible for our cross-team design efforts like our design system for dr.dk, our UX Playbook, and other cross-product strategic initiatives (Personalization, etc).

We continuously expand and build upon our design systems as new user needs arise, and to ensure that it is easy to work with for internal stakeholders.

### A/B Testing and Experimentation
We've recently introduced a new A/B testing tool, and I'm currently spearheading an effort to onboard and train our Product Managers, Product Owners and UX Designers.

This is part of a larger effort to instill a continuous discovery mindset in the organsiation. At DR, continuous discovery work follows a slightly revised Double Diamond model with a focus on user feedback, prototyping and experimentation as early as possible.

### Events and On-Going Projects
Aside from the on-going work on the core product portfolio, we often work on time-sensitive or event-based projects throughout the year. This includes one-off websites and apps for things like sport championships, national or international elections, or the passing of a significant cultural figure or royalty.

As we work on these projects, we seek to use established patterns and design systems for consistency, but often use the opportunity to expand our design system, as new needs arise.

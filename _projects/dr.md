## The Danish Broadcasting Corporation
DR – the Danish Broadcasting Corporation – is Denmark's public service media enterprise (essentially Danish equivalent to the BBC). Each week nearly every single Dane interacts with one of DR's touch points; tuning into a TV channel, turning on the radio or using one of DR's digital products.

I'm currently leading the talented 10-person UX team that designs digital products at DR. Our product portfolio includes dr.dk (the most visited Danish website), DRTV and Radio streaming apps, DR's news app, the children's apps Ramasjang and Ultra, and many other products aimed at providing great public service for the Danish people.

+ Employees need to be able to quickly and easily tell if a check-in is successful or failed, when they scan a card.
+ Employees rely on profile photos to verify members' identities, when they scan their cards – so being able to see a large photo is important.
+ Each member has a "nickname", which is their preferred name for being addressed by staff. These need to be easy to read, when a card is scanned.
+ The solution should must portable, so that it can also be used at outdoor events or in other situations, where member cards need to be scanned.


Below are some of the ongoing and past projects, I've worked on at DR.

### Redesigning the front page of dr.dk (Work-in-progress)
DR.dk is one of the most visited Danish websites. We are currently in the process of redesigning the front page to ensure that it is personal and relevant to our users' needs.

### Dual Track Agile + Continuous Discovery
Over the past year the team and I have worked to implement Dual Track Agile across the department, and ensure that continuous discovery practices such as user research, prototyping and experimentation are first-class citizens in our teams' backlogs.

This has included transitioning UX from an “internal agency” model to a hub-and-spoke model with UX’ers and designers embedded in each of our cross-functional product teams.

### Design System - DR Elements
The team and I are responsible for our cross-team design efforts like our design system for dr.dk, our UX Playbook, and other cross-product strategic initiatives (Personalization, etc).

We continuously expand and build upon our design systems as new user needs arise, and to ensure that it is easy to work with for internal stakeholders.

### A/B Testing and Experimentation
We've recently introduced a new A/B testing tool, and I'm currently spearheading an effort to onboard and train our Product Managers, Product Owners and UX Designers.

This is part of a larger effort to instill a continuous discovery mindset in the organsiation. At DR, continuous discovery work follows a slightly revised Double Diamond model with a focus on user feedback, prototyping and experimentation as early as possible.

### Events and on-going projects
Aside from the on-going work on the core product portfolio, we often work on time sensitive or event-based projects throughout the year; large sport events, elections and the likes.

As we work on these projects, we seek to use established patterns and design systems for consistency, but often use the opportuity to expand our systems and new needs arise.

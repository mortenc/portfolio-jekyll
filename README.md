## What's this?
This is the repo for my personal website, [mortenchristoffersen.com](http://mortenchristoffersen.com). I rebuilt the site in Jekyll as a learning experience.

## Technologies:

* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) – Jekyll is the static site generator powering the new site
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) – Task manager and automation. Gulp is responsible for running all the small tasks like compiling and automatically reloading browsers.
